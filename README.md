# Advent Of Code

Public repo for some of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

A lot of this code is writen in the evenign simply to solve the the problems without much regard for code-quality

## Interesting solutions

- [2024 day 3](2024/3/part-1/README.md): The solution could be found with hardly invoking any code at all
- [2024 day 4](2024/4/part-2/doit.hs): This one was fun, so I cleaned it up a bit and made some comments.
